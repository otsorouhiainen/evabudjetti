Then run

```

2.a Start the app in the browser

   Run in terminal
   ```bash
   pnpm run web
   ```
2.b Android startup

   Run in terminal
   ```bash
   pnpm expo start
   ```
   then start Expo Go on your Android device (download latest Expo Go version from Google Play)
   Read QR Code from terminal with Expo Go (NOTE! Both devices need to be in the same Wi-fi network)

2.c Ios startup

   Run in terminal
   ```bash
   pnpm expo start
   ```
   then start Expo Go on your Ios device (download latest Expo Go version from App Store)
   Connect the device to the same Wi-fi network as the PC, the application should show up in the list in the application

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Contributing to Git

### !!! PLEASE FOLLOW THE BELOW GUIDELINES TO SUBMIT CODE

#### Starting a new feature

As you begin work on a new feature for the app, first make a new branch from 'nightly'

Also open a pull-request on that branch, **AS SOON AS YOU START WORK ON IT**

##### Why?

1. This ensures project managers have an easy time following development progress
2. Makes it easy for us to merge new features, without breaking the existing application fully
3. Ensures we always have a functioning version to demo for customers

#### Getting your changes approved

Once you have finished working on your feature, first check that all github checks have passed.

After that, request review from one of the senior developers. If they approve the changes, they will be merged. If not, you will be notified on what to change.
